history	see a list of previous commands
!45	run command #45 in the history list
!!	repeat the last command. Nice if you forget to use sudo. See example below:
	      mv ./my_script.sh /usr/local/bin/
	      sudo !!
ctrl + r	interactive search through history. Repeated presses of ctrl + r iterate backwards to the previous command.
history | grep <string>	display only the history with <string> in the command
df -h	shows free disk space on linux system.

When you run into ".nfs…… Device or resource busy" and cannot delete a directory:
	lsof +D ./ | awk '{print $2}' | tail -n +2 | xargs -r kill -9
	
	• awk grabs the PIDs.
	• tail gets rid of the pesky first entry: "PID".
	• xargs executes kill -9 on the PIDs. The -r / --no-run-if-empty, prevents kill command failure, in case lsof did not return any PID.
